# 2026-02-10 — Early Morning Session

### Strategies Created
1. **amm-strategy.sol** — Adaptive Volatility: Detects arb patterns, adjusts fees dynamically, uses asymmetric fees based on inventory
2. **amm-strategy-inventory.sol** — Inventory-Aware MM: Classic market making approach, skews fees to rebalance
